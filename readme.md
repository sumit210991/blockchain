# Readme #

This is the readme for this block chain project.  It will include the transaction of tokens to 10 different address.


## Obejective


Doing analysis on the smart contract which will be on ethereal test net network with node.js file for the contract interaction and to have a better knowledge on how the tokens distributed to the multiple accounts which are mentioned in the test net network. In this process we will be using test ethers for distribution and transfer, All the transactions will happen on the test net network, we will not be using the ethereal main net.


## SMART CONTRACT
There are six functions present in the contract  which are combined with the constructor which are trying to inherit the  interface. Before that we have seen the library above.
Core supply and functions- This feature is holding the total supply of tokens in any contract.

## Remix

Create new  workspace and create a social contract

## Etherscan

## Create Account on Metamask

Get the metamask crome extension

Expanded version

## Infura

Here we will the the contract details.

## Etherscan


## Compile and deployment

For the smart contract we will be using the Remix IDE which is accessible online. There is no requirement of any type of extension. After this wee need to follow some steps mentioned below.
1) Create our own work space.
2) New file in our work space.
3) Select the Compile from our navigation dashboard.
4) Compiler should be same as we have used in the contract and other all settings should be default, and then compile. After compiling the Abu will be generated which is required afterwards.
5)Deploy the code while using the Injected web3 where environment setting need to be done. After this it will connect to our Metamask account. Select the contract and then deploy.
6)As our contract is deployed, we will be getting the transactions we can see our transaction on Etherscan.

## Requirements for Assignment ##

### 1. create an ethereum account ###
This is completed inside metamask (12 words, create an account, fund with Ropsten ether)

### 2. Create an ERC20-compliant, fixed-supply token
using open zeppelin contract, 

### 3. Deply to Ropsten
deploying using injected web3 and metamask
